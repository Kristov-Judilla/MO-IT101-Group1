## Payroll Hub (MotorPH Payroll System)

Payroll Hub is a simple Java-based payroll system for MotorPH employees that:

- Calculates work hours with a 15-minute grace period for tardiness
- Computes gross pay based on worked hours, overtime, and holiday pay
- Applies government deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, withholding tax)
- Determines net pay after deductions
- Reads employee data from CSV files for processing
- Saves payroll data to a CSV file for record-keeping

üìä **Expected Output**

Below is an example output for Employee ID 10001 with a pay period from 2024-06-03 to 2024-06-18, with 15 minutes of tardiness (within the grace period) and 8 hours worked on Independence Day (2024-06-12):

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open in NetBeans**

- Open NetBeans and select `File > Open Project`.
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory (`MO-IT101-Group1/MotorPH-Payroll-System`) and open the project.
- Ensure the `opencsv.jar` library is added to the project‚Äôs libraries (if not already included).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run Payroll Hub**
