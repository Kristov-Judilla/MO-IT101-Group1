## 🚀 Get Started: Usage Instructions

Get started with Payroll Hub in just a few steps:

1️⃣ **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kristov-Judilla/MO-IT101-Group1.git
```

2️⃣ **Open in NetBeans**

- Open NetBeans and select `File > Open Project`.
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory (`MO-IT101-Group1/MotorPH-Payroll-System`) and open the project.
- Ensure the `opencsv.jar` library is added to the project’s libraries (if not already included).

3️⃣ **Run Payroll Hub**

- Ensure `Employee.csv` is in the `data` directory with the required employee data.
- Right-click `MotorPH.java` in the `Projects` tab and select `Run File`.
- Follow the prompts to enter the employee ID, pay period, hours worked, overtime, tardiness, days late, and holiday work details.
- View the payroll statement in the console and check `MotorPHPayslip.csv` for saved data.
- **Note**: Ensure `MotorPHPayslip.csv` is not open in another application (e.g., Excel) while running the program, as this may cause a "file in use" error when saving the payroll data.
